# YOLOv3 Object Detection

## Overview
This project implements a YOLOv3-based object detection system. YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once, Version 3) is a powerful, real-time object detection algorithm capable of detecting multiple objects within an image or video frame. This repository includes scripts for training the YOLOv3 model on the COCO dataset, as well as scripts for performing object detection using the trained model.

## COCO Dataset
The COCO (Common Objects in Context) dataset is used for training and evaluating the YOLOv3 model. COCO is a large-scale object detection, segmentation, and captioning dataset. It contains over 200,000 labeled images with more than 80 object categories. Below are the links to download the necessary parts of the COCO dataset:

- **COCO 2017 Train/Val Annotations [241MB]**: Contains the annotations (bounding box coordinates and class labels) for both training and validation images.
  - [Download COCO 2017 Train/Val Annotations](http://images.cocodataset.org/annotations/annotations_trainval2017.zip)

- **COCO 2017 Training Images [118K/18GB]**: Contains around 118,000 images for training purposes.
  - [Download COCO 2017 Training Images](http://images.cocodataset.org/zips/train2017.zip)

- **COCO 2017 Validation Images [5K/1GB]**: Contains around 5,000 images for validating the model's performance.
  - [Download COCO 2017 Validation Images](http://images.cocodataset.org/zips/val2017.zip)

After downloading, unzip these files into the `data/` directory. The directory structure should look like this:

## Getting Started

To get started with this project:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. **Install Dependencies**: Install the required Python packages such as TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, and NumPy.

3. **Download COCO Dataset**: Download and unzip the COCO dataset into the `data/` directory as specified above.

4. **Download YOLOv3 Weights**: Download the pre-trained YOLOv3 weights file and place it in the `model/` directory.

5. **Train the Model**: Use the `train.py` script to train the model on the COCO dataset.

6. **Run Object Detection**: Use the `detect.py` script to perform object detection on new images or video streams.

## Usage

- **Training**: Run the `train.py` script to train the YOLOv3 model with your dataset.

- **Detection**: Run the `detect.py` script to detect objects in an input image using the trained model.
