# YOLOv3 Object Detection

## Overview
This project implements a YOLOv3-based object detection system. YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once, Version 3) is a powerful, real-time object detection algorithm capable of detecting multiple objects within an image or video frame. This repository includes scripts for training the YOLOv3 model on the COCO dataset and performing object detection using the trained model.

## COCO Dataset
The COCO (Common Objects in Context) dataset is used for training and evaluating the YOLOv3 model. COCO is a large-scale object detection, segmentation, and captioning dataset. It contains over 200,000 labeled images with more than 80 object categories. 

### Download Instructions:
1. COCO 2017 Train/Val Annotations [241MB]: Contains the annotations (bounding box coordinates and class labels) for both training and validation images.
   
   [Download COCO 2017 Train/Val Annotations](http://images.cocodataset.org/annotations/annotations_trainval2017.zip)
   
2. COCO 2017 Training Images [118K/18GB]: Contains around 118,000 images for training purposes.
   
   [Download COCO 2017 Training Images](http://images.cocodataset.org/zips/train2017.zip)
   
3. COCO 2017 Validation Images [5K/1GB]: Contains around 5,000 images for validating the model's performance.
   
   [Download COCO 2017 Validation Images](http://images.cocodataset.org/zips/val2017.zip)

After downloading, unzip these files into the `data/` directory.

## YOLOv3 Model Files

```

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AmithYallati/AmithYallati-YOLOv3_Object_Detection.git
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Download COCO Dataset
Use the `download_coco.py` script to download and unzip the COCO dataset into the `data/` directory:

```bash
python download_coco.py
```

### 4. Download YOLOv3 Weights
Run the following script to download the YOLOv3 weights:

```bash
python download_yolov3.py
```

### 5. Train the Model
Use the `train.py` script to train the model on the COCO dataset:

```bash
python scripts/train.py
```

### 6. Run Object Detection
Use the `detect.py` script to perform object detection on new images or video streams:

```bash
python scripts/detect.py
```

## Usage

### Training
To train the YOLOv3 model with your dataset, run:

```bash
python scripts/train.py
```

### Detection
To detect objects in an input image using the trained model, run:

```bash
python scripts/detect.py --input path_to_your_image_or_video
```

## Output
When running the `detect.py` script, the output will include:

- Annotated Images: Images with detected objects highlighted by bounding boxes.
- Detection Results: A list of detected objects with their confidence scores.
